# carparkviewer: NTU Techfest Hackathon 2023, Team 49
A JSON file reader that displays car park information. Made in Unity.

1) open the .exe file.
2) Windows Defender might block you from opening the program, click on Run Anyway.
3) Once the program is running, the program opens a file explorer. Select the sample_carpark .json file.
4) The program will display the car park information.
5) You can try changing the data in the .json file and run it again, like adding an additional floor, or changing some the occupancy numbers. The program should still be able to read and display information as long as the .json format remains the same.
